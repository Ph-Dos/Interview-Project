Configurations, you made it to the secound round of the interview process. For this project you will be creating a disparity map then generating a point cloud from the disparity map.

</p>

## Setup

Start by cloning the "clone" branch, this is where you will do the project and what will be sumbitted.

```
git clone https://github.com/Ph-Dos/Interview-Project.git
```

<br>

<p>
<strong>Please develop your code in a python virtual environment to help maintain consistency across all projects.</strong> <br>
Assuming Python is installed on your PC, the following command should create a Python virtual environment in your current directory.
</p>

```
python3 -m venv env
```

To start the Python virtual environment run the following command in the same directory.

```
source ./env/bin/activate
```

Please keep track of the packages you install in the virtual environment so you can include them in your submission.

```
pip install ...
```

## Disparity Map

You can use any set of images to create a disparity map, but we recommend using one of the [Middlebury 2014 Stereo Datasets](https://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/scenes2014/)
