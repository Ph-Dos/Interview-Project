<br>
<br>
</p>

## Setup

<p>
Please develop your code in a python virtual environment to help maintain consistency across all projects. <br>
Assuming Python is installed on your PC, the following command should create a Python virtual environment in your current directory.
</p>

```
python3 -m venv env
```

To start the Python virtual environment run the following command in the same directory.

```
source ./env/bin/activate
```

Please keep track of the packages you install in the virtual environment so you can include them in your submission.

```
pip install ...
```
